    "**Answer: **  We'd like to find the simplest model that works effectively, following Occam's razor.  Our data set is small.  We will try three examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**.  The Naive Bayes method is especially good at small datasets.  This method is frequently used in spam detection, sentiment analysis and text classification.  The model does quite well in classification, where predictions are inexact but directionally correct.  The model assumes all input attributes are independent, hence its \"naive\" in how variables appear in the real world.  Therefore, models with high interactions between attributes don't fare as well.  The model is solved quickly through calculus, a plus when we're looking to reduce computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision Tree Classifier**.  A decision tree performs the classic \"twenty questions\" method from childhood, asking a question of one attribute after another.  We have many features in our data, and not a lot of examples.  Of those examples we have, the data are skewed.  Decision trees excel in these environments.  They help us ferret out which of the features really matter.  Decision Trees have stared into the heavens, classifying astronomical images from the Hubble Telescope, yet are also grounded, helping forecast weather and soil behavior.  Decision trees are quick to overfit to  data, and aren't the best for continuous outputs where regressions fare better.  Since we want a model that's easy to explain, simple to run, and quick to find a classification, Decision Trees are a good candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors**. KNN is the simplest of the learning algorithms, working well on basic classification problems.  This method (KNN) attempts to find a small number of existing students (K) that are most like a new student.  If those K students, on average, tend to pass, then we'll say this new student is likely to pass.  Otherwise, the student will be predicted to fail.  We often find KNN in recommendation engines, where systems want to find products that people like you have bought.  KNN is also used to detect anomalies such as equipment malfunctions and credit card fraud.  KNN is lazy, in that it uses the data we feed it to predict outcomes.  This is fine for small datasets likes ours, not so great for large (>> 1MM) datasets."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
